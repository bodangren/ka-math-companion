## Implementation Notes
- Subsequent unit pages will expand each bullet into learning objectives, prerequisites, and alignment notes.
- Track future imports in `docs/` for technical architecture; reserve `curriculum/` for instructional content.
- Maintain Khan Academy terminology to streamline cross-referencing with platform resources.
