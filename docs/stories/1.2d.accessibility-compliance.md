# Story 1.2d: Implement accessibility compliance for base components

**Epic**: #15
**GitHub Issue**: #22
**Status**: Draft

## Story

As a QA engineer and developer, I want accessibility compliance for all base components, so that users with disabilities can use the application effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
3. Screen reader testing passed
4. Focus management implemented correctly
5. Accessibility documentation created

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Implementation Overview
- Use axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Implement ARIA labels and roles where needed
- Ensure proper focus indicators
- Document accessibility patterns used

### Technical Constraints
- **DEPENDS ON**: Story 1.2b (components must exist)
- Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Support keyboard-only navigation
- Work with screen readers
