# Story 1.2b: Build base component library (Button, Input, Card, Modal)

**Epic**: #15
**GitHub Issue**: #20
**Status**: Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want a base component library with common UI elements, so that I can build features consistently and efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Button component with variants (primary, secondary, danger)
2. Input component with validation states
3. Card component for content containers
4. Modal component with portal rendering
5. All components use design tokens from 1.2a

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Implementation Overview
- Build components with TypeScript and proper typing
- Ensure components are composable and flexible
- Implement proper prop types and defaults
- Use design tokens for all styling
- Follow React best practices (hooks, composition)

### Technical Constraints
- **DEPENDS ON**: Story 1.2a (design tokens must be completed first)
- Must use design tokens for all styling
- Support theme switching
- Maintain accessibility standards
