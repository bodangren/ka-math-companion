# Story 1.3a: Implement global state management (Zustand)

**Epic**: #15
**GitHub Issue**: #23
**Status**: Draft

## Story

As an architect and developer, I want global state management with Zustand, so that I can efficiently manage application-wide state with minimal boilerplate.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Zustand installed and configured
2. Store structure designed for app state
3. Slices created for different domains (user, curriculum, progress)
4. DevTools integration for debugging
5. Example state usage demonstrated

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Implementation Overview
- Design store architecture with architect input
- Use Zustand slices pattern for modularity
- Integrate with React DevTools
- Consider middleware for persistence/logging
- Document state management patterns

### Technical Constraints
- Must support static export (client-side only state)
- Work with localStorage persistence (Story 1.3c)
- Support performance optimization patterns (Story 1.3d)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Install and configure Zustand
  - [ ] Add Zustand package
  - [ ] Create store directory structure
  - [ ] Set up TypeScript types for store
- [ ] Design store architecture
  - [ ] Design state shape for user domain
  - [ ] Design state shape for curriculum domain
  - [ ] Design state shape for progress domain
  - [ ] Document store architecture decisions
- [ ] Implement store slices
  - [ ] Create user slice (preferences, settings)
  - [ ] Create curriculum slice (loaded data, filters)
  - [ ] Create progress slice (completed lessons, scores)
  - [ ] Combine slices into main store
- [ ] Add DevTools integration
  - [ ] Install Zustand DevTools middleware
  - [ ] Configure DevTools for debugging
  - [ ] Test state inspection capabilities
- [ ] Create usage examples
