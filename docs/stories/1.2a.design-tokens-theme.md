# Story 1.2a: Define design tokens and theme system

**Epic**: #15
**GitHub Issue**: #19

## Story

As a UX expert and developer, I want a design token system with theming support, so that I can maintain consistent visual design across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Design tokens defined for colors, typography, spacing, shadows
2. Theme system supporting light and dark modes
3. CSS variables or styled-components tokens implementation
4. Theme switching functionality
5. Documentation of design token usage

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Implementation Overview
- Create design token schema (JSON or TypeScript)

- Support system preference detection for theme
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios for both themes
- Document token naming conventions

### Technical Constraints
