# Story 1.3c: Implement state persistence for user preferences/progress

**Epic**: #15
**GitHub Issue**: #25
**Status**: Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want state persistence for user data, so that user preferences and progress are saved between sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. localStorage/IndexedDB persistence implemented
2. User preferences (theme, settings) persisted
3. Progress data (completed lessons, scores) persisted
4. Hydration strategy for initial load
5. Migration strategy for schema changes

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Implementation Overview
- Use Zustand persist middleware or custom solution
- Choose localStorage for simple data, IndexedDB for complex
- Implement proper serialization/deserialization
- Handle storage quota and errors gracefully
- Document persistence schema and versioning

### Technical Constraints
- **DEPENDS ON**: Story 1.3a (Zustand store must exist)
- Static site requires client-side persistence only
- Support data export/import for user portability
- Handle storage quota limits
