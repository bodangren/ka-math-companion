# Story 1.3b: Set up data fetching and caching (React Query/SWR)

**Epic**: #15
**GitHub Issue**: #24
**Status**: Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want data fetching and caching with React Query or SWR, so that I can efficiently manage server state with automatic caching and revalidation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Query or SWR installed and configured
2. Query client with sensible defaults
3. Custom hooks for curriculum data fetching
4. Cache invalidation strategies defined
5. Error and loading state handling

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Implementation Overview
- Choose between React Query and SWR based on needs
- Configure cache times and stale-while-revalidate behavior
- Create custom hooks for API endpoints
- Implement error boundaries for query errors
- Document data fetching patterns

### Technical Constraints
- Static site means "server" data is JSON files at build time
- May need to adapt for static data loading patterns
- Support offline-first capabilities

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Choose and install data fetching library
  - [ ] Evaluate React Query vs SWR for static site
  - [ ] Install chosen library
  - [ ] Set up TypeScript types
- [ ] Configure query client
  - [ ] Create QueryClientProvider setup
  - [ ] Configure default cache times
  - [ ] Set up stale-while-revalidate behavior
  - [ ] Configure retry and error handling
- [ ] Create custom hooks for curriculum data
  - [ ] Create useCurriculum hook
  - [ ] Create useLessonData hook
  - [ ] Create useProgressData hook
  - [ ] Add TypeScript types for all hooks
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation
  - [ ] Define invalidation patterns
  - [ ] Implement manual invalidation methods
  - [ ] Set up automatic revalidation rules
- [ ] Handle error and loading states
  - [ ] Create error boundary for queries
  - [ ] Implement loading state components
  - [ ] Add error state UI patterns
- [ ] Create documentation
  - [ ] Document data fetching patterns
  - [ ] Create usage examples
  - [ ] Document cache strategies

## Definition of Done

- React Query/SWR configured with provider
- Custom hooks created for curriculum data
- Caching working with proper invalidation
- Error and loading states handled
- Data fetching documentation complete
