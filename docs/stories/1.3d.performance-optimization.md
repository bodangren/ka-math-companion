# Story 1.3d: Optimize performance with memoization

**Epic**: #15
**GitHub Issue**: #26
**Status**: Draft

## Story

As a developer and QA engineer, I want performance optimization with memoization, so that the application remains responsive with minimal unnecessary re-renders.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. useMemo and useCallback used appropriately
2. React.memo for expensive components
3. Selector optimization for state access
4. Performance benchmarks established
5. Performance monitoring in place

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Implementation Overview
- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify bottlenecks
- Implement memoization where measurements show benefit
- Create reusable selector hooks for derived state
- Set up performance budgets and monitoring
- Document performance patterns

### Technical Constraints
- **DEPENDS ON**: Story 1.3a (state management must exist)
- Optimize based on measurements, not assumptions
- Maintain code readability while optimizing
- Document performance trade-offs
