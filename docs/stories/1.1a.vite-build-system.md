# Story 1.1a: Configure modern build system (Vite) with HMR

**Epic**: #15
**GitHub Issue**: #16
**Status**: Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want a modern build system with Vite and Hot Module Replacement, so that I can develop efficiently with fast builds and instant feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Vite configuration with optimized build settings
2. Hot Module Replacement working for React components
3. Source maps enabled for debugging
4. Build optimization for production
5. Fast development server startup (<2s)

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Implementation Overview
- Migrate from existing webpack/Next.js build to Vite
- Ensure compatibility with existing TypeScript configuration
- Configure React plugin for Vite
- Set up environment variable handling

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain static export capability for GitHub Pages
- Preserve existing TypeScript strict mode
- Maintain compatibility with pnpm workspace setup

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Install and configure Vite with React plugin
  - [ ] Add Vite dependencies to package.json
  - [ ] Create vite.config.ts with base configuration
  - [ ] Configure React plugin and JSX settings
- [ ] Configure HMR for React components
  - [ ] Enable Fast Refresh for React
  - [ ] Test HMR with existing components
- [ ] Set up environment variable handling
  - [ ] Configure .env file support
  - [ ] Document environment variable conventions
- [ ] Configure production build optimization
  - [ ] Set up code splitting
  - [ ] Configure minification and tree shaking
  - [ ] Enable source maps for debugging
- [ ] Update package.json scripts
  - [ ] Create `dev` script for Vite dev server
  - [ ] Create `build` script for production build
  - [ ] Create `preview` script for build preview
- [ ] Test and verify build performance
  - [ ] Measure dev server startup time
  - [ ] Verify HMR speed
  - [ ] Test production build output

## Definition of Done

- `pnpm dev` starts Vite dev server with HMR
- `pnpm build` produces optimized production bundle
- Source maps work in development mode
- Build time improved from baseline
- Documentation updated with new build commands
