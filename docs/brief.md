# KA Math Companion - Project Brief

## Executive Summary

KA Math Companion is a dual-platform educational enhancement system that transforms Khan Academy's Integrated Math 3 curriculum into an engaging, mastery-based learning experience. The project addresses the critical gap between static video content and active learning by creating two interconnected platforms: a Teacher Presentation System featuring dynamic slide decks with embedded practice generators, and a Student RPG Learning System that gamifies mathematical concepts through narrative-driven gameplay.

This hybrid approach leverages Khan Academy's comprehensive curriculum while solving the engagement and practice challenges faced by both educators and students. Teachers gain presentation-ready materials that eliminate manual content preparation, while students experience mathematics through an immersive role-playing game that provides contextualized practice and immediate feedback. The system maintains pedagogical rigor while dramatically increasing student motivation and teacher efficiency.

## Problem Statement
