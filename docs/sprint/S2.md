## Definition of Done

- All 11 stories completed and code reviewed
- `pnpm dev` runs with Vite and HMR
- `pnpm test` runs with ≥80% coverage
- `pnpm lint` passes with no errors
- Design system components available in Storybook
- Theme switching works (light/dark mode)
- State management operational with persistence
- All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Performance benchmarks established
- Documentation updated for all new systems

## Success Metrics

- **Build Performance**: Dev server starts in <2s
- **Test Coverage**: ≥80% code coverage
- **Accessibility**: All components pass axe-core tests
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals within targets
  - LCP < 2.5s
  - FID < 100ms
  - CLS < 0.1

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Vite migration breaks existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of existing features after Vite setup
- **Fallback**: Keep webpack config available for rollback

### Risk: Design system delays feature development
- **Mitigation**: Focus on 4 essential components first, iterate later
- **Fallback**: Use unstyled components if design tokens delayed

### Risk: State management complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple slices, architect review before expansion
- **Fallback**: Use React Context if Zustand proves too complex

## Sprint S2 → S3 Handoff

Upon completion, Sprint S2 will provide:
- Modern build system ready for feature development
- Consistent design system with theme support
- Robust state management and persistence
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Accessibility compliance framework

Sprint S3 can then focus on:
- Epic 2: Core UI Components (building on design system)
- Feature development using established patterns
- Enhanced user experience with solid foundation

## Notes

- BMAD agents assigned via labels (not GitHub assignees)
- All stories have local markdown files in `docs/stories/`
- Epic tracker issue [#15](https://github.com/bodangren/ka-math-companion/issues/15) tracks overall progress
