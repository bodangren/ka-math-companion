# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Organization

The enhancement work is organized into focused epics that build upon each other to deliver the complete UI enhancement vision. Each epic contains multiple user stories that break down the work into manageable, deliverable increments.

### Epic Hierarchy

1. **Epic 1: Foundation and Infrastructure**
   - Establishes the technical foundation for UI enhancements
   - Includes core architecture improvements and tooling setup
   - Prerequisite for all subsequent epics

2. **Epic 2: Core UI Components**
   - Develops the reusable component library
   - Implements the design system and visual improvements
   - Provides building blocks for feature development

3. **Epic 3: Navigation and Layout**
   - Redesigns the application navigation structure
   - Implements responsive layout improvements
   - Enhances the overall user flow and information architecture

4. **Epic 4: Interactive Practice System**
   - Builds the enhanced practice problem generators
   - Implements real-time feedback and assessment tools
   - Creates engaging interactive learning experiences

5. **Epic 5: Teacher Dashboard**
   - Develops comprehensive teacher tools
   - Implements class management and analytics
   - Provides insights into student progress and performance

6. **Epic 6: Student Experience Enhancements**
   - Focuses on student-facing improvements
   - Implements gamification and engagement features
   - Enhances the learning journey and progress visualization

## Story Structure

### User Story Format

Each user story follows the standard format:
```
As a [user type],
I want [functionality],
so that [benefit/value].
```

### Story Components

Each story includes:
- **User Story**: Clear statement of user need and value
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable requirements
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation guidance and constraints
- **Tasks**: Breakdown of development work
- **Definition of Done**: Completion criteria

### Story Sizing

Stories are sized to be completed in 1-3 days of focused development:
- **Small Stories**: 0.5-1 day (simple enhancements, bug fixes)
- **Medium Stories**: 1-2 days (feature additions, component development)
- **Large Stories**: 2-3 days (complex features, integration work)

## Dependency Management

### Epic Dependencies

```
Epic 1 (Foundation) → Epic 2 (Components) → Epic 3 (Navigation)
                                    ↓
Epic 4 (Practice) ← Epic 5 (Teacher) → Epic 6 (Student)
```

### Story Dependencies

- **Technical Dependencies**: Stories requiring infrastructure or components
- **Functional Dependencies**: Stories building on previous functionality
- **Data Dependencies**: Stories requiring specific data structures or migrations

## Risk Mitigation

### Epic-Level Risks
- **Technical Complexity**: Each epic includes technical spikes for complex areas
- **Integration Challenges**: Regular integration testing between epics
- **Performance Impact**: Performance testing at epic completion

### Story-Level Risks
- **Uncertainty**: Technical spikes for uncertain story implementations
- **Dependencies**: Clear identification and management of story dependencies
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all story implementations

## Progress Tracking

### Epic Completion Criteria
- All stories completed and tested
- Integration testing passed
- Performance requirements met
- Documentation updated
- Stakeholder approval received

### Story Acceptance Criteria
- Functional requirements implemented
- Non-functional requirements met
- Tests written and passing
- Code review completed
- Documentation updated

## Release Planning

### Incremental Delivery
- **Epic 1-2**: Foundation and components (Month 1-2)
- **Epic 3-4**: Navigation and practice system (Month 2-3)
- **Epic 5-6**: Teacher and student enhancements (Month 3-4)

### Milestone Reviews
- **Epic Reviews**: Review and approval at epic completion
- **Sprint Reviews**: Regular progress demonstrations
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Continuous feedback collection and incorporation

## Quality Assurance

### Epic-Level Testing
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-epic functionality testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Stakeholder validation
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality preserved

### Story-Level Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Component and function level testing
- **Integration Testing**: Component interaction testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: User workflow testing
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance validation
