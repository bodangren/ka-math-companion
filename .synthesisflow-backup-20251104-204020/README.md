# SynthesisFlow Migration Backup

This directory contains a backup of your project documentation before SynthesisFlow migration.

## Backup Contents

- `docs/` - Complete backup of your original docs/ directory (if it existed)
- `migration-manifest.json` - The migration plan that was executed
- `rollback.sh` - Script to restore the original state

## Restoration Procedure

If you need to rollback the migration and restore your original documentation:

### Option 1: Use the Rollback Script

Run the provided rollback script from your project root:

```bash
bash .synthesisflow-backup-20251104-204020/rollback.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a safety backup of the current state (before rollback)
2. Restore the original docs/ directory from backup
3. Remove SynthesisFlow additions (docs/specs/, docs/changes/) if they're empty
4. Preserve any non-empty directories to prevent data loss
5. Clean up empty directories

### Option 2: Manual Restoration

If you prefer manual control:

1. **Backup current state** (in case you want to keep some changes):
   ```bash
   mv docs docs-after-migration
   ```

2. **Restore original docs/**:
   ```bash
   cp -r .synthesisflow-backup-20251104-204020/docs .
   ```

3. **Clean up** (if desired):
   ```bash
   rm -rf docs-after-migration
   ```

## Safety Notes

- This backup is READ-ONLY - never modify files in this directory
- Keep this backup until you're confident the migration was successful
- The rollback script is safe to run - it won't delete this backup
- You can manually inspect files in this backup at any time
